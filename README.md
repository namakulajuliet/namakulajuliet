composition for evaluating the variables. Curriculum development can be regarded in two ways: as 'process' and 'product'. As the conditions imply 'process' is concerned with the methods and means 'how' whereas the 'product' looks at the outcomes, the end product 'what'.

A continuum of Curriculum Development Models
The Wheeler model (1967)
The Wheeler model of curriculum development (1967), or cyclic model, asserts that curriculum should be a continuous cycle which is responsive to changes in the education sector and makes appropriate modifications to account for these changes. It targets situational evaluation: the framework in which the curriculum decisions are taken is considered important, as this is believed to help make the very best decisions. This model is comprised of five interconnected phases:

Aims, goals and objectives
Selection of learning experiences
Selection of content
Organisation and integration of learning experiences and content
Evaluation
Once the circuit has been implemented once, it commences again at the first step and goes on onward to constantly improve the curriculum in the face of any changes that may have been imposed or happen naturally. It really is different from other models in that selection of learning experiences' comes before selection of content': it specifically gears the content in the curriculum to learners, where most models follow the opposite structure. Wheeler viewed evaluation as especially important, proclaiming that [e]valuation permits us to compare the actual final results with the expected results [] [without it] it is impossible to learn whether objectives have been realized, and if indeed they have, to what magnitude' (Wheeler, 1976, cited in Carl, 2009). While Wheeler's approach, like other cyclical models, has been popular in teaching practice because of its overall flexibility and relevance to learners specifically situations, it isn't always practical to work with because of their time constraints. Undertaking an in depth situational evaluation that Wheeler advocates is a time-consuming process that can be difficult to place into practice in the busy conditions in modern educational practice.
